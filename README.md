The motivation behind this project was to study the age at which most suicides occur in males and females. This research could later be used to further study why people at a certain age are most likely to commit suicide the most. This would help in giving help to the said people of the specified age group in a timely manner so that suicide could be prevented in that age group.

This project will also analyse whether people are more likely to commit suicide as they grow older, if most suicides are committed at a certain age or there is no positive correlation between age and the number of suicides committed.

The dataset used in this project has been taken from Kaggle from the user Szamil 
 and the link to the Dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/dornani/widandsuicide.

The data belongs to World Health Orginazation.
